<h1 align=center>Fresh Manjaro</h1>

<h3 align=center><em> Roasted from perfect coffee, a theme that's fresh and clean </em></h3>

I've just painfully installed Manjaro & tested my other theme, but I got a feeling that the forest green vibe of Matcha was built for the OS' originality, so I decided to remix one of my favourite themes, Frapoppé, & called it Manjaro Fresh! A soothing theme that is actually forked from my Cosmic model of Frapoppé based on Fausto Korpsvart's Catppuccine GTK Theme! It actually consists of not only the theme, but also the icons, font & wallpapers, all in one repo! So if you want to install my new Manjaro Fresh theme, follow these steps:

## How to install the theme:-

- Open your terminal & type or copy-paste the following command:-

  <pre>git clone https://github.com/all-junks/Fresh-Manjaro.git; cd Fresh-Manjaro; sudo chmod 755 install.sh; sudo chmod +x install.sh; ./install.sh</pre>
- Exit terminal after installation
### FOLLOW THESE STEPS IF YOU USE XFCE DE!:-
- Open your settings & open <code>Appearance</code>
